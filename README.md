# ToDo CLI

## Overviev
###### This project is an attempt at learning how to create a CLI on my own. 

    This project is a CLI todo list with a singel .json file as storage. The goal is to be able to use this CLI for kanban style todo-lists instead of relying on apps such as Notion or Trello and to have it handy in the terminal.


## The Future

- Better styling
- Look into sqlite3 instead of .json for storage
